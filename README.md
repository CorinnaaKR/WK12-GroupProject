# Week 12 Assignment

## story based learning tool focused on the prevent scheme

Thursday: After choosing groups, we were put in breakout rooms and began discussing ideas. We agreed on the idea and then broken down the planning tasks. We created a trello board for tasks to be completed and assigned, a google doc for our communication plan, user stories and general planning + mark scheme, a figma for the wireframe, canva for the web site map with an initial table to track what information we would need for the database, and then DrawSQL to template the database structure.
Steph did the canva (site map) & set up documentation (trello, google docs ect.)
Corinna did the figma (wireframe)
Callum did the draw SQL.
Once a large portion of the paperwork was done, Corinna started researching radicalisation and creating a story template with setting, context, signs and contacts - all the information needed for creating the story. Steph has been looking through the ink documentation and structure, as well as alternative methods of structuring the website if we can’t use ink or struggle to make it compatible with the website. Callum downloaded ink and started playing around with it to gauge structuring, compatibility and any plugins it would need.

Friday Plan: Test repo with Ink and deployment - deep div into Ink documentation and creating a story structure - based on how ink creates structure when coding the story e.g. knotts, diverts ect.

Friday:
Callum to use the test repo he made yesterday to figure out how to pull/highlight sections of the text or key words and store them in a side bar for the user to review later.
Steph to deep dive into ink documentation with a focus on components and features, looking for anything that would be useful to have in our story - looking a the demons provided by an online tutorial from codebar.
Corinna also to deep dive into next documentation with focus on story story and layout - using components to create story template structure

We used a youtube tutorial produced by code bar on how to use inky as a reference point.

Callum successfully managed to select text to put into a sidebar that displayed on the page and could be referred back to. We as a team discussed dynamic routes and folder structure which Steph then added into canva. Corinna began templating the story in inky, researching to see if there's a way to display text messages as an actual text thread. Before lunch, we were all reading the documentation to establish structures, features and any limitations there might be.

Callum to play around with the test repo and css styling for the ink components for mobile.
Steph to look at accessibility features we might include, such as aria labels - screen reader.
Corinna to continue writing first draft of the story ready for ready through at the end of the day so group can collaborate on decide choices within the story.

At the end of the end, we did a run through of the first draft of the story, made some word changes, and went through the choices to check if all group members agreed on the content. Callum confirmed react avatar would be easy to import and use as a component. Steph drew up our file structure template in canva to map out our files and dynamic routes.

At the very end of the day, Corinna set up the repository and added Callum & Steph as collaborators ready to hit the ground running on Monday.

Monday morning, we established a plan for the day and divided up tasks.
Callum was on creating the file structure in the repo, and then agreed to move onto clerk and setting it up. Corinna had structured the story in ink over the weekend but couldn’t see it in the output window so she put it in discord, and Steph agreed to have a play about with it to get it working and then would get it imported to the repo. Corinna agreed to set up the supabase tables, put the secret keys in the repo then get it deployed on vercel.
