        Our Interactive learning portal focuses on the UK Government&apos;s
        counter-terrorism strategy known as Prevent. Through this, we aim to
        provide an engaging means to help identify or assess vulnerable
        individuals who may be at risk of radicalisation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Through the use of interactive fiction, we aim to bring a conscientious
        and active approach to this training to further cement the importance of
        this training in the user&apos;s mind by immersing them in the situation
        and how they might handle this interaction as opposed to static learning
        such as leaflets, documentation or slides.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Through this increased engagement, we hope to see users take this
        information onboard to a greater degree, allowing them to recall the
        information and act appropriately in the moment.
      </p>
      <br />

        As the programme expands, we aim to include a greater variety of
        situations, branching narratives, and greater depth of thinking to fully
        explore the scenarios presented, driving safety through learning,
        engagement and conscious decision making.{" "}
